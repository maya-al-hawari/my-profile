				<h2>Music and me : love story 🎸</h2>
				<p>
					I'am a palestinian girl but I've always lived in France I've spent quarter of each year in Syria until 2010. This is why I am very attached to Palestinian and Syrian musics. I love music from the heritage of these cultures but also more recent music on which we can easily ambience. I let you listen to some of this music!

				<h2>Series and me: a passion 🎬 </h2>
				<p>
					The majority of the people very much like the American series but me it is not my case, I don't like it at all. I greatly prefer the Syrian, Lebanese and Turkish series, I don't know why but I think you have to try and I assure you that you won't regret!

				<h2>People I love : all my life 💟</h2>
				<p>
					I am very attached to my family and that for a long time. The people who matter most to me are first my parents and my siblings, then my uncle and finally my best friends. One of the values that I have always been taught is respect, whether it is self-respect or respect for others, and I think that thanks to this value I managed to keep very good relationships with these people.
